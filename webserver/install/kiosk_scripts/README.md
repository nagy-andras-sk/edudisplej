# Kiosk Scripts

This directory contains scripts that are deployed to `/opt/edudisplej/kiosk_scripts/` on the target system during installation and updates.

These scripts are synchronized automatically during:
- Initial installation (install.sh)
- System updates (update.sh)

The scripts in this directory are deployed alongside the `init` folder contents to maintain the complete EduDisplej system configuration.
